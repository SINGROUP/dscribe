DScribe is a Python package for transforming atomic structures into fixed-size
numerical fingerprints. These fingerprints are often called "descriptors" and
they can be used in various tasks, including machine learning, visualization,
similarity analysis, etc. To get started you can check the :doc:`basic tutorial
<tutorials/basics>`.

.. note::
   Version **0.4.0** includes a fix to the layout of the SOAP feature vector.
   See issue `#48 <https://github.com/SINGROUP/dscribe/issues/48>`_ for more
   details. These changes break the backwards compatibility of the SOAP feature
   vectors. It is thus encouraged to start using version 0.4.0 or above if
   working with SOAP.
