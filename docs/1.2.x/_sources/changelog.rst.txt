Changelog
=========
 - 1.2.2:
    - New features:
        - Changed the default naming of some descriptor input parameters. E.g.
          radial cutoffs are now always called :code:`r_cut` in all descriptors.
          The old names can still be used but the new ones are preferred.
    - Fixes:
        - Fixed an issue with Coulomb matrix ordering using :code:`sorted_l2`
          that was introduced in version 1.2.0. See issue `#89 <https://github.com/SINGROUP/dscribe/issues/89>`_.

 - 1.2.0:
    - New features:
        - Added the :doc:`Valle-Oganov descriptor <tutorials/descriptors/valleoganov>`
        - Added numerical derivatives for the Coulomb matrix
        - Added a tensorflow implementation of :doc:`the force-field training
          tutorial <tutorials/machine_learning/forces_and_energies>`, courtesy
          of `xScoschx <https://github.com/xScoschx>`_
    - Fixes:
        - Fixed a memory leak with the SOAP descriptor. See issue `#69
          <https://github.com/SINGROUP/dscribe/issues/69>`_.
        - Increased the numerical precision used for ACSF. See issue `#70
          <https://github.com/SINGROUP/dscribe/issues/70>`_.

 - 1.1.0:
    - New features:
        - Added support for lmax <= 20 for the SOAP GTO basis.
        - Added support for weighting the gaussians contributing to the atomic
          density. For more details see :doc:`the updated SOAP tutorial
          <tutorials/descriptors/soap>` (and issues `#20
          <https://github.com/SINGROUP/dscribe/issues/20>`_, `#58
          <https://github.com/SINGROUP/dscribe/issues/58>`_).
        - Added :code:`attach`-argument for the :code:`derivatives`-function (see issue `#63
          <https://github.com/SINGROUP/dscribe/issues/63>`_).

 - 1.0.0:
    - New features:
        - Added possibility to calculate the derivatives of the SOAP descriptor
          with respect to atom positions. For now, only non-periodic structures
          are supported. Supports numerical derivatives for any SOAP
          configuration, and analytical derivatives when using the GTO radial
          basis.
    - Breaking changes:
        - The :code:`periodic` attribute now instructs the code to take into account
          the periodicity of the system as defined by the :code:`pbc`-attribute
          the :code:`ase.Atoms`. So in addition to setting
          :code:`periodic=True` in the descriptor, also make your system
          periodic in the wanted directions through the :code:`pbc` attribute.
        - The sparse output now uses the sparse matrices from the
          `sparse library <https://sparse.pydata.org/en/stable/>`_-library.
          This change is motivated by the need for n-dimensional sparse arrays
          in various places. See more at the :doc:`documentation page for
          sparse output. <tutorials/sparse>`
        - The output shapes have been made more consistent across different
          descriptors: global descriptors now produce 1D flattened output and
          local descriptors produce 2D flattened output for a single system.
          Whenever multiple systems are given, an additional dimension is added
          that runs across the different systems: for systems with the same
          number of atoms the output becomes a five-dimensional array,
          otherwise the output becomes a list of four-dimensional arrays.

 - 0.4.0:
    - Fixes:
        - Fixed an issue with the layout of the SOAP descriptor. The output
          size was incorrectly missing elements. See issue `#48
          <https://github.com/SINGROUP/dscribe/issues/48>`_.
    - New features:
        - Added support for different averaging modes in SOAP. See issue `#44 <https://github.com/SINGROUP/dscribe/issues/44>`_.
    - Other:
        - Migrated completely from Cython to pybind11.

 - 0.3.5:
    - New features:
        - Added support for Python 3.8. See issue `#40 <https://github.com/SINGROUP/dscribe/issues/40>`_.

 - 0.3.2:
    - Improvements:
        - Improved performance for SOAP in combination with very large systems. See issue `#31 <https://github.com/SINGROUP/dscribe/issues/31>`_.

 - 0.2.8:
    - Other:
        - Removed support for Python 2.
