class ValleOganov(MBTR):
    """Shortcut for implementing the fingerprint descriptor by Valle and Oganov
    for :math:`k=2` and :math:`k=3` using MBTR. Automatically uses the right
    weighting and normalizes the output, and can only be used for periodic
    systems.

    You can choose which terms to include by providing a dictionary in the
    k2 or k3 arguments. This dictionary should contain information
    under three keys: "sigma", "n" and "r_cut". See the examples below.

    For more information on the weighting and normalization used here as well
    as the other parameters and general usage of the descriptor, see the MBTR class.

                the atomic numbers that are present for an individual system, but

                encountered when creating the descriptors for a set of systems.
                Keeping the number of chemical species as low as possible is
                preferable.
            k2 (dict): Dictionary containing the setup for the k=2 term.
                Contains setup for the discretization and radial cutoff.
                For example::

                    k2 = {
                        "sigma": 0.1,

            k3 (dict): Dictionary containing the setup for the k=3 term.
                Contains setup for the discretization and radial cutoff.
                For example::

                dense numpy array.
