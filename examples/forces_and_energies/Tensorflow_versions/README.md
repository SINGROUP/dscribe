# TensorFlow implementations of Force Field tutorial/example

	- `training.py` is a simple translation of the pytorch version.
	- `training_fast.py` is an optimised version of	`training.py` using Computation Graphs to 
		have similar speed to pytorch version. 

## Training time for each implementation (on Google Colab)

	- PyTorch (58.8351 seconds)
	- TensorFlow (329.4324 seconds)
	- TensorFlow Fast (46.1316)
